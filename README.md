# #!/Simon
Hello! Welcome to Simon. Simon is a Python library that powers your entire semantic search stack: OCR, ingest, semantic search, extractive question answering, textual recommendation, and AI chat.

Check out [this online demo of the tool!](https://wikisearch.shabang.io/)

## Quick Start
Are you ready to ~~rock ü™®~~ Simon? Let's do it.

- Pre-reqs
    - PostgreSQL 15 database with the Vector plugin. A service like [supabase.io](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/wiki/Supabase-Database-Setup) or [neon.tech](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/wiki/Neon-Database-Setup) is easiest, but you can also [self host](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/wiki/Detailed-Setup-Guide#self-hosted-database).
    - An [OpenAI GPT-4 API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
    - Optional: [Java](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/wiki/Detailed-Setup-Guide#java), if you want to use Simon's OCR.

After that, we can get started!

### Install the Package
You can get the package from PyPi.

```bash
pip install simon-search
```

### Connect to Database

```python
import simon

# connect to your database
context = simon.create_context(
  "PROJECT_NAME",               # an arbitrary string id to silo your data.
                                # (store and search are per-project.)
  "sk-YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",     # must support GPT-4

  # postgres options. get these from your postgres provider.
  { "host": "YOUR_DB_HOST.com",
    "port": 5432,
    "user": "YOUR_USERNAME",
    "password": "PASSWORD, or None",
    "database": "YOUR_DATABASE_NAME"
  }
)

# if needed, provision the database
simon.setup(context) # do this *only once once per new database*!!
```

You can also [store the OpenAI key and Database info as environment variables or in a `.env`](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/wiki/Detailed-Setup-Guide#set-environment-variables).

### Storing Some Files

```python
ds = simon.Datastore(context)

# storing a remote webpage (or, if Java is installed, a PDF/PNG)
ds.store_remote("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", title="Chickens")

# storing a local file (or, if Java is installed, a PDF/PNG)
ds.store_file("/Users/test/file.txt", title="Test File")

# storing some text
ds.store_text("Hello, this is the text I'm storing.", "Title of the Text", "{metadata: can go here}")
```

<!-- We also have advanced ingestors and lower level APIs to bulk read lots of data; check out [the ingest recipes folder](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/tree/main/examples/ingest) for tutorials on how to store everything from S3 buckets to Google Drive files. -->

### Search Those Files
We all know why you came here: search!

```python
s = simon.Search(context)

# Semantic Search
results = s.search("chicken habits")

# Recommendation (check out the demo: https://wikisearch.shabang.io/)
results = s.brainstorm("chickens are a species that")

# LLM Answer and Extractive Question-Answering ("Quoting")
results = s.query("what are chickens?")
```

That's it! Simple as that. Want to learn more? Read the [full tutorial](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/blob/main/examples/tutorial.py) to learn about the overall organization of the package.

<!-- Check out the [the examples folder](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/tree/main/examples/) for diving deep into Simon---speeding up your ingest, building a minimal REST-API, or fine tuning the LLM outputs: anything under the sun! -->
