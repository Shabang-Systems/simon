# #!/Simon
Hello! Welcome to Simon. Simon is a Python library that powers your entire semantic search stack: OCR, ingest, semantic search, extractive question answering, textual recommendation, and AI chat.

Check out [this online demo of the tool!](https://wikisearch.shabang.io/)

## Quick Start
Are you ready to ~~rock~~ Simon? Let's do it.

First, [setup PostgreSQL 15 with the Vector plugin with these instructions](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/wiki/Detailed-Setup-Guide#database-and-credentials). If you want to use Simon's built in OCR tooling, you will also need to [setup Java](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/wiki/Detailed-Setup-Guide#java).

After that, we can get started!

### Install the Package
You can get the package from PyPi.

```bash
pip install simon-search
```

### Connect to Database

```python
import simon

# connect to your database
context = simon.create_context("project_name", "sk-your_open_ai_api_key",
                               {"host": "your_db_host.com",
                                "port": 5432,
                                "user": "postgres",
                                "password": "super secure, or None",
                                "database": "dbname"})

# if needed, provision the database
simon.setup(context) # do this *only once once per new database*!!
```

The `project_name` is an arbitrary string you supply as the "folder"/"index" in the database where your data get stored. That is, the data ingested for one project cannot be searched in another.

You optionally can store the OpenAI key and Database info in an `.env` file or as Bash shell variables [following these instructions](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/wiki/Detailed-Setup-Guide#set-environment-variables) to streamline the setup.

### Storing Some Files

```python
ds = simon.Datastore(context)

# storing a remote webpage (or, if Java is installed, a PDF/PNG)
ds.store_remote("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", title="Chickens")

# storing a local file (or, if Java is installed, a PDF/PNG)
ds.store_file("/Users/test/file.txt", title="Test File")

# storing some text
ds.store_text("Hello, this is the text I'm storing.", "Title of the Text", "{metadata: can go here}")
```

<!-- We also have advanced ingestors and lower level APIs to bulk read lots of data; check out [the ingest recipes folder](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/tree/main/examples/ingest) for tutorials on how to store everything from S3 buckets to Google Drive files. -->

### Search Those Files
We all know why you came here: search! 

```python
s = simon.Search(context)

# Semantic Search
results = s.search("chicken habits")

# Recommendation (check out the demo: https://wikisearch.shabang.io/)
results = s.brainstorm("chickens are a species that") 

# LLM Answer and Extractive Question-Answering ("Quoting")
results = s.query("what are chickens?")
```

That's it! Simple as that. Want to learn more? Read the [full tutorial](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/blob/main/examples/tutorial.py) to learn about the overall organization of the package.

<!-- Check out the [the examples folder](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/tree/main/examples/) for diving deep into Simon---speeding up your ingest, building a minimal REST-API, or fine tuning the LLM outputs: anything under the sun! -->
