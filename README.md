# #!/Simon
Hello! Welcome to Simon. Simon is an open-source pipeline which allows for the ingestion, storage, and processing of a large body of textual information with LLMs and a Postgres Database.

</p>

Check out [this online demo of the tool!](https://wikisearch.shabang.io/)

This document serves as a very-minimal quickstart as we work to build this tool. Needless to say, this tool is alpha, at best. Proceed for your own risk and fun!
  
## Getting Started

### Database and Credentials
You need an psql instance running somewhere with the `vector` plugin [available here](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) (and installed on most major cloud providers) to support Simon. 

You will also need OpenAI credentials. This will be available be either with the OpenAI public API, or Azure OpenAI Services.

Get the postgres connection credentials and OpenAI credentials, and keep it for use in the steps below. 

### Install Simon!
You can install Simon from pypi.

```
pip install simon-search
```

all versions are figured with `Python 3.11`; all versions `>3.9` should be supported.

### Set Environment Variables
There are a few secret credentials (database, OpenAI) that we mentioned above, and it is more convenient when these credentials are stored in an `.env` file.

Collect your credentials from the steps before, and create an `.env` file (copy the `.env.example` [available at this link](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/blob/main/.env.example) and set values after the = sign) or through simple `export` directive in your bash shell.

An example of all the environment variables needed is in the `.env.example` file [available at this link](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/blob/main/.env.example).

Values set in your shell will override those in the `.env` file.

### Provision your Database

You need to manually seed the database schema when you're first setting up. To do this, fill out the environment variables found in `.env.example` [available at this link](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/blob/main/.env.example) into the `.env` file in your local directory, then run:

```
simon-setup
```

To setup your database. If the program exits without error, you are good to go.

### Run the code!

You are now ready to ~~rock~~ Simon! Follow the usage examples in `tutorial.py` [available here](https://github.com/Shabang-Systems/simon/blob/main/tutorial.py) get a full overview of the Python API.

### REST API 

We also offer a fairly minimal API through `api.py`. To be able to do this, you need to first install the API server requirements:

```
pip install 'simon-search[web]'
```

then, run:

```
gunicorn simon.api:rest -w [num_workers] --timeout 1000
```

No documentation quite yet, but we hope to get that up shortly.

## Misc notes

You'll need java installed/available to run `Tika` which is used for fetching/manipulating external data.

Check that it's available:

```
java -version
```

If not, install is system dependent.

(Quick fix for Ubuntu + Debian-based distros: `sudo apt install default-jre`)
